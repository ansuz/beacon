# To-do

## Infra

* make one-time build commands so you don't need to watch

## Code

* clearly separate:
  * generic libraries
  * browser-specific UI
  * CLI-only only methods
* add browser notifications
  * and a blinking favicon in case people don't allow native notifications
    * or if they're not supported

## Design

* make it prettier

## Docs

* keep going on the wiki
