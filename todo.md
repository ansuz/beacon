# To-do

## Infra

* make one-time build commands so you don't need to watch
* fix demo TLS settings
  * https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=cryptography.dog
  * [CAA](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/caa-record/)

## Code

* clearly separate:
  * generic libraries
  * browser-specific UI
  * CLI-only only methods
* add browser notifications
  * and a blinking favicon in case people don't allow native notifications
    * or if they're not supported

## Design

* make it prettier
* display a userlist somehow
  * userlist is wrong on first page load for some reason


## Docs

* keep going on the wiki
* go over 'production' setup
